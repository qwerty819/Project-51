    Hi, my name is Anish E and I created this origami website for people who don't know how to make basic origami designs and to have a fun time.
    Origami is a fun way to pass the time while learning something new as well. You can make all types of objects with origami ranging from cranes
    to a boat. Plus, these are just the simple things. There are many more complex origami projects you can take on as well .
